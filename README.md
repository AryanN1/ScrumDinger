# ScrumDinger

Getting Started with Scrumdinger
Learn the essentials of iOS app development by building a fully functional app using SwiftUI.

# Part I
Scrum List
The main screen of the app displays a summary of each of the user’s daily scrums. Users can tap a row in the list to view the details of a scrum or create a new scrum by tapping the Add (+) button in the navigation bar.

# Part 2
Scrum Detail and Edit
The detail screen shows more information about a scrum, including the name of each attendee and a list of previous meetings. Users can modify any of the scrum’s attributes by tapping the Edit button. The edit screen includes a picker with which users can change the color theme of each meeting. Tapping the Start Meeting button at the top of the list starts a new meeting timer.

# Part 3
Meeting Timer
The progress bar at the top of the meeting timer shows the elapsed and remaining time for the meeting. The app displays the name of the current speaker in the center of the screen and a button to advance to the next speaker at the bottom of the screen.
Segments in a circular progress ring represent each attendee. When an attendee uses all their time, Scrumdinger plays a “ding” sound and adds a new segment to the ring. The meeting ends when the ring is full.
